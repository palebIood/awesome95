# awesome95
My retro Win95 inspired theme for AwesomeWM and dotfiles for Alacritty.

-- OTHER STUFF --
For the Alacritty theme (mostly color schemes from what i understand) i use chicago95 from: https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty-theme
For the terminal font i used LessPerfectVGA font from the Chicago95 theme at: https://github.com/grassmunk/Chicago95
For the GTK theme, i also used the one provided by Chicago95.
For Icon theme i use classic95, but the modified ones at: https://github.com/quadpixels/classic95
For the UI font i used Inconsolata, which is part of google fonts. https://github.com/google/fonts. Ask chatGPT how to install it on your distro, at least on Arch is with AUR ttf-google-fonts-git
